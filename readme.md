# AudLoop (an audio app to loop around) V0.2.2

This little app can be used to loop a part of an audio file.

## How to use

First, you load an audio file with the **Load Audio File** button in the drop down menu at the top left of the app.

At the bottom, there is a media player for playing the audio file. File lengths are expressed in milliseconds.

At the center is a "tag" manager. In this manager, you can add condition to the media player timeline, such as a **Go To** condition to skip a section or rewind and loop.
